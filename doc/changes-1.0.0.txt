
Changes and new features in 1.0.0:
----------------------------------

-Made changes to make Google App Engine (GAE) compatible.
Gowut and the Gowut "Showcase of Features" demo app can now be run on GAE.

-Table.Add() now only ensures the table has enough rows, and enough cells in the row.
Previously it called Table.EnsureSize() if the cell was nonexistent. 

-New methods for Table: Trim() and TrimRow().
This comes handy for example if the table contains cells where colspan > 1 is set;
by calling this method we can ensure no empty cells will be rendered at the end of such rows.
For follow-up see issue #11: https://github.com/icza/gowut/issues/11

-TODO Incompatible change: renamed all constants to conform to the Go naming conventions
(from UPPER_CASE to UpperCamelCase).

-TODO The Gowut UI Server (gwu.Server) now supports adding custom headers which will be set in all server responses.

-Other minor changes, improvements and optimization.
