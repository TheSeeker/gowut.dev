
Changes and new features in 1.0.0:
----------------------------------

-Exported a new Writer which is used to render components, it is passed to all Render() methods.
It is now possible to use components implemented entirely by you (this Writer is the last piece that was not exported previously).

-Renamed all identifier names to conform to the Go naming conventions (from UPPER_CASE to CamelCase).
(This is a backward incompatible change.)

-Made changes to make it work Google App Engine (GAE) compatible.
Gowut and the Gowut "Showcase of Features" demo app can now be run on GAE.
Live demo is available here: https://gowut-demo.appspot.com/show

-Table.Add() now only ensures the table has enough rows, and enough cells in the row.
Previously it called Table.EnsureSize() if the cell was nonexistent. 

-New methods in Table: Trim() and TrimRow().
These come handy for example if the table contains cells where colspan > 1 is set.
By calling this method we can ensure no empty cells will be rendered at the end of such rows.
For follow-up see issue #11: https://github.com/icza/gowut/issues/11

-TODO The Gowut UI Server (gwu.Server) now supports adding custom headers which will be set in all server responses.
